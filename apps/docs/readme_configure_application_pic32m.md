# Configuring a PIC32M based Application to be bootloaded

- For PIC32M devices custom linker script has to be created and added to application project.
- All the Application code including the reset handler and IVT's has to be placed in Program flash memory as bootloader is residing in boot flash memory
- Below mentioned configuration may vary from device to device and based on the application being configured

## Setting Up the Application linker script

- For Quck start, Refer to pre developed application linker scripts placed in
    - **bootloader_apps_usb/apps/usb_device_hid_bootloader/test_app/firmware/src/\<config\>/app_XX.ld**
    - **bootloader_apps_usb/apps/usb_host_msd_bootloader/test_app/firmware/src/\<config\>/app_XX.ld**

- The vector address of a given interrupt is calculated using Exception Base (EBASE) CPU register, which provides a 4 KB page-aligned base address value located in the kernel segment (kseg) address space.
- The MIPS32 core requires that Interrupt Vector Tables (IVTs) be placed on a 4 KB boundary
- The address is calculated by using EBASE and VS values. The VS bits provide the vector spacing between adjacent vector addresses
- Each vector in the table is created as an output section located at an absolute address based on values of the _ebase_address and _vector_spacing symbols


### For PIC32MZ Device

- Reset Address for the application to be loaded through bootloader should match the Application start address mention in bootloader project.
- For devices with larger boot flash memory where the bootloader resides completely in boot flash memory the application start address by default will be start of program flash memory **0x9D000000**
- The Initial 4KB are used by Reset Handler and cache_init section
- Below are few configurations to be taken care in the linker script

```
PROVIDE(_vector_spacing = 0x0001);
PROVIDE(_ebase_address = 0x9D001000);

_RESET_ADDR                 = 0x9D000000;

kseg0_program_mem  (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x9D001000, LENGTH = 0x200000 - 0x1000

kseg1_boot_mem          : ORIGIN = 0x9D000000, LENGTH = 0x480

kseg1_boot_mem_4B0      : ORIGIN = 0x9D0004B0, LENGTH = 0x1000 - 0x4B0

/* Boot Sections */
.reset _RESET_ADDR :
{
  KEEP(*(.reset))
  KEEP(*(.reset.startup))
} > kseg1_boot_mem

.cache_init :
{
  *(.cache_init)
  *(.cache_init.*)
} > kseg1_boot_mem_4B0
...

/* Interrupt vector table with vector offsets */
.vectors _ebase_address + 0x200 :
{
  /*  Symbol __vector_offset_n points to .vector_n if it exists,
   *  otherwise points to the default handler. The
   *  vector_offset_init.o module then provides a .data section
   *  containing values used to initialize the vector-offset SFRs
   *  in the crt0 startup code.
   */
  . = ALIGN(4) ;
  __vector_offset_0 = (DEFINED(__vector_dispatch_0) ? (. - _ebase_address) : __vector_offset_default);
  KEEP(*(.vector_0))
  ...
  ...
  /* Default interrupt handler */
  . = ALIGN(4) ;
  __vector_offset_default = . - _ebase_address;
  KEEP(*(.vector_default))
} > kseg0_program_mem

```

### For PIC32MX Devices

- The bootloader code resides in from start of Program flash memory, hence the application start address has to be after the end of bootloader.
- Change _ebase_address to the new boundary, plus enough pages to get the exceptions to start at an address on a 4K (0x1000) boundary. This is to align it on the boundary required by the MIPS core.
- Below are few configurations to be taken care in the linker script

```
PROVIDE(_vector_spacing = 0x0001);
PROVIDE(_ebase_address = 0x9D009000);

_RESET_ADDR                    = 0x9D000000 + 0x8000; /* Size of Bootloader is 0x8000 */

kseg0_program_mem     (rx)  : 0x9D009000, LENGTH = 0x80000 - 0x490 - 0x1000 - 0x8000 /* Size of Bootloader is 0x8000 */
kseg1_boot_mem              : ORIGIN = 0x9D008000, LENGTH = 0x490

/* Boot Sections */
.reset _RESET_ADDR :
{
  KEEP(*(.reset))
  KEEP(*(.reset.startup))
} > kseg1_boot_mem
...

.vector_0 _ebase_address + 0x200 + ((_vector_spacing << 5) * 0) :
{
   KEEP(*(.vector_0))
} > kseg0_program_mem
ASSERT (_vector_spacing == 0 || SIZEOF(.vector_0) <= (_vector_spacing << 5), "function at exception vector 0 too large")

.vector_1 _ebase_address + 0x200 + ((_vector_spacing << 5) * 1) :
{
   KEEP(*(.vector_1))
} > kseg0_program_mem
ASSERT (_vector_spacing == 0 || SIZEOF(.vector_1) <= (_vector_spacing << 5), "function at exception vector 1 too large")
...
...

```

### Note

- As the Device configuration bits should be updated by bootloader only, the application linker script should not have any device configuration settings
- Device configurations need to discarded from final hex file for the application project.

```
/DISCARD/ : { *(.config_*) }
```

## MPLAB X Settings

### For Bootloading the application with usb_device_hid_bootloader

- Check the **Normalize hex file** option as shown below, as the Unified bootloader host application takes hex file as an input. Normalizing the hex file will make sure the data in the hex file is arranged sequentially

    ![application_config_normalize_hex](./images/application_config_normalize_hex.png)

### For Bootloading the application with usb_host_msd_bootloader

- Specifying post build option to automatically generate the binary file from hex file once the build is complete

    ```
${MP_CC_DIR}/xc32-objcopy -I ihex -O binary ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.hex ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.bin
    ```
