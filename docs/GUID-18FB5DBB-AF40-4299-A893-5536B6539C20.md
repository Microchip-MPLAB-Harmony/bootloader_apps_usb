### Bootloader Application

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|bootloader/firmware/pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X|MPLABX Project for [PIC32MX Ethernet Starter Kit II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320004-2)|

### Test Application

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|test\_app/firmware/pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X|MPLABX Project for [PIC32MX Ethernet Starter Kit II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320004-2)|

## Setting up [PIC32MX Ethernet Starter Kit II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320004-2)

-   Mount [PIC32MX Ethernet Starter Kit II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320004-2) on the J1 connector of [Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320002)

-   Connect **TX pin** of [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to **U2RX pin of J11** header on [Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320002)

-   Connect **RX pin** of [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to **U2TX pin of J11** header on [Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320002)

-   Connect **GND pin** of [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to **GND pin of J11** header on [Starter Kit I/O Expansion Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320002)

-   Connect mini USB cable to the [USB UART click](https://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) board. This will enumerate the USB to UART port.

-   For programming, Connect mini USB cable to the 'Debug USB' connector\(J7\) on the [PIC32MX Ethernet Starter Kit II](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320004-2) to the computer

    -   **Do not connect the mini USB cable to a USB Hub**

-   Use the USB Host Type A Connector J4 to connect USB Flash Drive to the starter kit

-   Jumper J5 must be shorted


## Running the Application

1.  Open the test application project *test\_app/firmware/pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X* in the IDE

2.  Build the project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

3.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X* in the IDE

4.  Build and program the application using the IDE

5.  **LED1** will be Turned On once programming is completed and bootloader starts running

6.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer to get test application messages through UART once bootloaded

7.  Configure the serial port settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

8.  Copy the generated application binary file to a USB Flash drive from the Host PC

    -   *<harmony3\_path\>\\bootloader\_apps\_usb\\apps\\usb\_host\_msd\_bootloader\\test\_app\\firmware\\pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X\\dist\\pic32mx\_eth\_sk2\\production\\pic32mx\_eth\_sk2.X.production.bin*

9.  Rename the copied application binary file to **image.bin**

10. Insert the USB Flash Drive with the application binary **image.bin** to the Host connector on the device

11. Once the application is successfully programmed **LED3** should start blinking and you should see below output on the console

    ![output](GUID-85766B71-F137-4B0A-8BA8-B94723A3608B-low.png)

12. Remove the USB Flash Drive from the Host connector

13. Press and hold the Switch **SW1** to trigger Bootloader from test application and you should see below output

    ![output](GUID-334C25E1-AD62-4367-B951-9CC66ECFC209-low.png)

14. Repeat Steps 10-12 once and jump to Step-15

    -   This step is to verify that bootloader is running after triggering bootloader from test application in Step 13

15. **Press and hold** the Switch **SW1** and then Power cycle the device to force trigger bootloader at startup

16. Repeat Steps 10-12 once

    -   This step is to verify whether bootloader is triggered by switch press at reset


## Additional Steps \(Optional\)

-   To bootload any other application refer to [Application Configurations](GUID-6E96B464-6390-4AD8-A7C5-98AC2758D05F.md)

-   Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)
