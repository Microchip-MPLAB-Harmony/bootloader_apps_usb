# USB Device HID Bootloader

This example application shows how to use the Bootloader Library to bootload an application using USB Device HID protocol.

**Bootloader Application**

-   This is a bootloader application which resides from

    -   The starting location of the flash memory region for SAM devices

    -   The starting location of the Boot flash memory region for PIC32MZ devices

    -   The starting location of Program Flash memory for PIC32MK, PIC32MX and PIC32MM devices

-   It uses the USB Device HID port with **Product ID 0x3C** to receive application hex from host PC using the Unified Bootloader Host Application

-   It calls the bootloader\_Tasks\(\) function which receives application to be programmed into flash memory over USB Device HID port

-   The application glows an LED once bootloader firmware is running

-   Trigger Methods

    -   It uses the On board Switch as bootloader trigger pin to force enter the bootloader at reset of device

    -   It checks for bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** from the starting 16 Bytes of RAM to force enter bootloader at reset of device


**Test Application**

-   This is a test application which resides from

    -   The end of bootloader size in device flash memory for SAM devices

    -   The end of bootloader size in Program Flash memory for PIC32MK, PIC32MX and PIC32MM devices

    -   The start of Program Flash memory for PIC32MZ devices

-   It will be loaded into flash memory by bootloader application

-   It blinks an LED and provides console output

-   It uses the On board Switch to trigger the bootloader from firmware

    -   Once the switch is pressed it loads first 16 bytes of RAM with bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** and resets the device
