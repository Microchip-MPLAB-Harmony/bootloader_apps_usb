Licensee will use Confidential Information only to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement and will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid unauthorized access, disclosure, and use of Confidential Information. Such measures include, but are not limited to, the highest degree of care that it uses to protect its own information of a similar nature, but not less than reasonable care. Licensee will only disclose Confidential Information to its employees, subcontractors, consultants, auditors and representatives (collectively \"Representatives\") who have a need to know such information and who have use and confidentiality obligations to Licensee at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Licensee is responsible for disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information by its Representatives. Use of Confidential Information for personal gain, for the benefit of a third party or to compete with Microchip, whether directly or indirectly, is a breach of this Agreement. Licensee will notify Microchip in writing of any actual or suspected misuse, misappropriation, or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information that comes to Licensee's attention. Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement; (ii) is known or becomes known to Licensee from a source other than Microchip without restriction and without breach of this Agreement or violation of Microchip's rights, as demonstrated by credible evidence in existence at the time of disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by credible evidence in existence at the time of independent development; or (iv) is disclosed generally to third parties by Microchip without restrictions similar to those contained in this Agreement. Licensee may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required under law, rule, or regulation (including those of any national securities exchange), by subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process, or by a court or administrative agency (each a \"Requirement\"'), provided, that to the extent permitted by applicable law, Licensee will provide prompt notice of such Requirement to Microchip to enable Microchip to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict such disclosure. (b) Return of Materials. Upon Microchip's request and direction, Licensee will promptly return or destroy the Confidential Information, including any physical information or materials provided to Licensee (together with any copies, excerpts, syntheses, CD ROMS, diskettes, etc.), and, in the case of information derived therefrom, provide written certification that all the Confidential Information has been expunged from any such materials or that all such materials have been destroyed. Further, if Licensee or its affiliates become competitors of Microchip, and Microchip notifies Licensee in writing of its status as a competitor in a given market, then Licensee will promptly engage in the return and certification process described above in this Section 5(b). 6. Ownership and Retention of Rights. All rights, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Software, including any derivative works of the Software and any incremental modifications to the Software whether made by or for Licensee or Microchip (collectively, \"Microchip Property\"), are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Microchip, whether such Microchip Property is separate or combined with any other products. Licensee, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, agrees to, and does hereby, assign to Microchip or its designee all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to derivative works of and any incremental modifications to the Software. Licensee will take (and will cause its affiliates, their subcontractors, and all related individuals to take) all action as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to perfect and secure the ownership, licenses, intellectual property and other rights of or to Microchip as set forth in this Agreement.

This Agreement automatically terminates immediately if Licensee violates the restrictions set forth in Sections 1, 2 or 4(a). Microchip may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if (a) Licensee or its affiliates become competitors of Microchip, or (b) Licensee breaches any other term of this Agreement and does not cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach from Microchip. Upon termination of this Agreement, (i) the license grants in Sections 1 and 2(b) terminate, and (ii) Licensee will return to Microchip or destroy (and certify the destruction of) all Microchip Property and Confidential Information in its possession or under its control, and all copies thereof. The following sections survive termination of this Agreement: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 8. Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance (\"Dangerous Applications\"). Dangerous Applications include the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or any environment or system in which the failure of the Software could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Microchip specifically disclaims (a) any express or implied warranty of fitness for use of the Software in Dangerous Applications; and (b) any and all liability for loss, damages and claims resulting from the use of the Software in Dangerous Applications. 9. EU Consumers - Applicable Terms. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS APPLY INSTEAD OF SECTIONS 9 AND 10 BELOW: Microchip and its licensors will not be liable (a) for any loss suffered by Licensee in connection with the Software where such loss was not reasonably foreseeable when the Software was first downloaded by Licensee, even if such loss was the result of negligence or the failure of Microchip and its licensors to comply with this Agreement; or (b) irrespective of the basis of claim, for any loss of revenue, profit or other business or economic loss suffered. Some Software is made available to Licensee free of charge, and Licensee may at any time download further copies without charge to replace the Software initially downloaded and others may require a fee to be downloaded, or to download any further copies. In all circumstances, to the extent liability may lawfully be limited or excluded, the cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors will not exceed USD$1,000 (or equivalent sum in the currency of the country in which Licensee resides). However, none of the foregoing limits or excludes any liability for death or personal injury arising from negligence, or for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other cause that by law cannot be excluded and limited. 10. Warranty Disclaimers. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. MICROCHIP MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STAUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, IF PROVIDED, WILL NOT EXPAND THESE WARRANTIES. IF CUSTOMER IS A CONSUMER, THE ABOVE WILL NOT ACT TO EXCLUDE YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS. 11. Limited Liability. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, CONTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, HOWEVER CAUSED, OR ANY LOSS OF PRODUCTION, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF MICROCHIP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. MICROCHIP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$1,000. 12. General. (a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona and the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in Maricopa County, Arizona for any dispute relating to this Agreement. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, this Agreement is subject to the laws of the country in which the Software is downloaded, and, to the extent so mandated by such laws, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in connection with this Agreement. (b) Unless the parties have a mutually executed agreement relating to the licensing of this Software by Microchip to Licensee (\"Signed Agreement\"), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes and replaces prior or contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or communications between the parties regarding the Software, including any purchase orders. If the parties have a Signed Agreement, this Agreement does not supersede or replace that Signed Agreement. This Agreement will not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (c) Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (d) This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by law or otherwise, without Microchip's prior written consent. Any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization, transfer of all or substantially all assets or other change in control or majority ownership (\"Change of Control\") is considered an assignment for the purpose of this Section. Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. However, Microchip may assign this Agreement to an affiliate, or to another entity in the event of a Change of Control. (e) Licensee acknowledges its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Agreement would cause Microchip irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be an adequate remedy. Licensee, therefore, agrees if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated any such provisions then Microchip may seek equitable relief, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. (f) Authorized representatives of Microchip shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee's premises and to audit Licensee's records and inventory of Licensee Products, whether located on Licensee's premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's adherence to the terms of this Agreement. (g) Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Software is being licensed to U.S. Government end users (i) only as Commercial Items, and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Microchip licenses. To the extent the Software (or a portion thereof) qualifies as 'technical data' as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. §252.227-7015(a)(5), then its use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of the Rights in Technical Data clause at 48 C.F.R. §252.227-7015.
